# Facial_Recognition

## ðŸ“ƒ About The Project
This is a flask app designed for face recognition, allowing users to upload images or capture photos using their device's camera. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the app analyzes the facial features of the uploaded/captured images and matches them against a pre-trained database of known faces. Upon recognition, the app provides information about the recognized individuals, such as their names or associated profiles. The user-friendly interface and efficient processing make it a convenient solution for face recognition tasks.
